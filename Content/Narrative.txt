Goblin Beats

The goblins are a musical sea-faring folk - pirates even. They sail the ________ Seas in search for their long lost home, now only remembered through song and folklore.


PC wakes up on board on one of the goblins' ships on their way back from yet another unsuccessful search mission. They found PC unconscious, floating on some debris. He doesn't immediately remember details, just little flashes... TODO ...

PC does something that gets the ship in trouble. Not necessarily malicious, although that could totally be one of the options.
